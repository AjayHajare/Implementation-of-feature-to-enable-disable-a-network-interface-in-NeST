# Implementation-of-feature-to-enable-disable-a-network-interface-in-NeST
NeST is open source Python
package that simplifies the process of performing networking
experiments by using Linux network namespaces.

NeST source code repository is maintained at  :-  https://gitlab.com/nitk-nest/nest

The paper introducing NeST is available at :- https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3404868.3406670

This repository contains an implementation of APIs that allow the NeST user to dynamically put "DOWN" network interface (veth i.e virtual ethernet) for some period of time and set it "UP" again after some period of time in the network.
